# OpenFOAM_tutorial_laminar_BL
This is a laminar boundary layer using OpenFOAM's icoFoam solver

boundary conditions:
1) top and bottom of entrance region:       zeroGradient
2) top and right side of flat plate region: zeroGradient
3) bottom of flat plate region:             noslip
4) left side of entrance region:            constant velocity
